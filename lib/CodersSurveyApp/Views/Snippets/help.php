	About Survey Editing
</h1>
<p>
	In this <b>first level</b> you can create, edit, delete and order the "pages". "Pages" are actually sections with an extra headline. They help to structure the poll. You can also run your whole survey with just one "page". In the <b>second level</b> you can edit the "page" title and create, edit delete and order "topics". "Topics" are the questions, but we thought it would be too simple when we just call em like that. In the <b>third level</b> however you can edit your "topics" and define the possible answers. Ah, by the way: answers are called "options", not answers. And there are also options for each "topic", like: what kind of answer is possible and if the topic is mandatory. We named these options "settings".

	Not confused yet? Watch this: When you got your survey ready it is "open". That means: users can give their input. However you can still come back here and edit everything. Then you can "close" the survey. "Closing" means that users can't give any input any more. But that doesn't mean that they can see the results of the survey. You need to generate the results first. While you do this, you can define "groups". "Groups" are actaully a kind of filter. Let's say your survey has 100 "topics" (questions). Now you choose the gender question ("topic") in the "Generate Survey" dialouge to be a "group" (filter). So you see the results with three different views: Answers by all, answers by the boys, answers by the girls.
